# Music streaming for Dreame robot vacuums

## What is this?

vaccuum-music is a pair of scripts that enable your vacum robot to play music!

## How does it work?

One script is executed locally (on your computer) which spins up a temporary web server which provides the music files. This script sends a "client" script to the robot, which connects to the server and plays all the files one by one.
